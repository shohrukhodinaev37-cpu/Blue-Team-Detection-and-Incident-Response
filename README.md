# Blue-Team-Detection-and-Incident-Response

👤About Me

This repository showcases hands‑on Blue Team projects focused on incident response, memory forensics, network analysis and threat detection.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical SOC‑level skills using real‑world attack scenarios, open‑source tools, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
